            <p>This page is made by <i>Veličković Đorđe</i> as <b>Project</b><mark id="dots" style="background-color: transparent; color: white; display: none">...</mark><mark id="more"> <b>Work</b> for <b>Computer Practicum II</b> subject of the <strong><i>University of Primorska</i></strong>.
                It is one of 3 Projects that students can choose. Due to global situation with the <i>COVID-19</i> and inability for Universities to
                stick with regular exams which require physical attendance, these Projects are counted as <strong>Midterm I</strong> exam.
                There are minimum requirements students have to meet such as <i>User Interface</i> design as well as <i>Optional Features</i>
                for a higher grade. By now you probably already know what I am shooting for.
                
                I'll give my best to make this page be fun and pleasurable experience to you but also for me to reach higher grades. <a href="./game/game.html"><strong id="joy">Enjoy!</strong></a></mark>
                <mark id="readBtn" onclick="readMore()">Read more</mark></p> <!--This is the main mark tag used in JavaScript. When clicked, another mark tag containing more text is shown and vice versa-->
